            <p2>Hi there folks! Nice of you to drop by :) Now that you're here, give yourself some time to click on each button to see some of the beautiful locations in California, and learn about what makes each of them so special! Also feel free to add any points on this map too, even if you already see a button for it, as everyone's story for each place is unique and deserves to be known!! Hope this helps you plan out your future travels around the state, and remember to do so safely! :)</p2>
